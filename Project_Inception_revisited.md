**Project Inception**

 The world we live in today is one that is ruled by Technology; one could say that technology 
 is like a bullet speed train that moves very fast on its tracks and that no one should miss.
 As a student in a challenging program such as the Microsoft Software and Systems  
 Administrator, I find myself knocking on the front door of this giant bullet speed train. 
 Although this is not a first time encounter with technology, I am humble and privileged to be 
 learning new, vital, industry leading skills through this program; this project section of the 
 program is essential in providing me with the industry hands-on crucial skills that will serve 
 me and ease my way into the  realm of Information Technology . The main goal in choosing 
 this program is not only to apply the skills I learn and continue to learn towards a real life 
 changing project, but also to witness Technology bring true positive changes in people's lives. 
 The first project that captured my mind is one that I named the Clean Water Initiative. This 
 initiative is an aim at providing clean water to populations living in remote areas of a west 
 African country. In these regions there are no water lines, and people usually rely on one or 
 two water points situated miles away. The project aims to satisfy the software and 
 technology part of the initiative by providing the following:
   1- A database containing all the data within the scope of the project such as the village 
   name and location, the number of inhabitants in each region, the maintenance crew and 
   their data, the list of deployed water pumps, pumps or order, etc..
 2- A graphical user interface for the database to allow an administrator to manage the 
   database.
 3- A programming code written to facilitate the autonomous running of the water stations 
   and also the maintenance of the site. This code will be uploaded to microcontroller and it 
   will   govern the way the water pumps will run.  
 4- A GSM module which will allow the remote access and operation of the water stations.   
   This project is similar to the Electric power consumption automatic meter reading with a 
   GSM module; although this project is very fascinating, another one has caught my interest. 
   This project is the second one I have reviewed and I found it to provide one of the most 
   direct ways to show how technology can save lives. It is titled High Water Detector System 
   for Automobiles. In recent years, natural disasters such as flooding have claim the lives of 
   any who found themselves in a flooded area and drove into a death trap. And I have 
   always  wondered what technology could do in these situations. This project gives an 
   answer to that question; it consists of designing and equipping automobiles with high
   water sensors that will detect the level of water a soon as the driver enters a flooded area, 
   and issue an alert. The aim is to prevent and discourage adventurous drivers to go on high 
   water. Another goal is to provide a set of  eyes for the unlucky driver who is heading into 
   high water during low visibility hours and in areas that are concealed. For this project one 
   will need the following:
   1- A database containing the manufacturer's specifications for each type of automobile.
   2- A programming code for interpreting the data gathered by the sensors and issuing the 
   alarm and notification.
   3- Sensors and a microcontroller.
   4- A user interface to display messages from the system and to allow the setting of the 
   system. This system is similar to the one used to control the level of water from two 
   bassins and to automatically start or stop a water pump based on the readings of an 
   ultrasound sensor. A third project encountered in my search is worth reviewing. It is the 
   Counter Season Agricultural Irrigation System. This project could have a positive impact in 
   the lives of farmers living in two-seasons weather pattern. During the dry season, 
   irrigation is sometimes the only way to grow crops and a good irrigation system means 
   surviving harsh conditions and conserving precious water. The project will need the 
   following:
   1- A programming code that will run the water pumps, monitor the growth of the 
   crops and communicate with the farmer.
   2 - Sensors for humidity, temperature , quantity of water dispensed, etc.. 
   3- A GSM unit to alert the farmer of any issue encountered.
   4- A user interface displaying the state of the system.
   This program is similar to the automatic irrigation system that it used to start and stop a 
   motor via GSM.
   Each of these projects brings me closer to my goals as they allow me to explore the 
   practicality of the concepts studied in class, and the ones needed at a workplace. These 
   projects provide me with invaluable hands-on learning opportunities, new challenges and 
   therefore problem-solving skills. All of these key factors will benefit me as I enter the 
   immensely diverse world of Technology.
